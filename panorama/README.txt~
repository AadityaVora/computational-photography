RESULT : Panorama.JPG

PROCEDURE:

Initially we have multiple images of a scene which we are suppose to stitch. Here for this assignment we have 10 images.
The methodology for creating the panorama is as follows:
1) Compute the ORB features from the two images which we need to stitch. Thus we will get the keypoints and the feature 
   descriptor for both the images
2) After getting the keypoints and feature descriptor from both the image we will do the feature matching. And compute which
   features match in both the images. By this procedure we shall get the common points between the two images.
3) From the matched points between the two images we shall select the best matching points from both the images in order to compute 
   the homography matrix.
4)
