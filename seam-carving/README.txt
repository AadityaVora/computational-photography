NAME : 		ADITYA VORA
ROLL NUMBER :	14410006
DEPARTMENT :	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING


PROBLEM-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement seam carving algorithm to delete and insert certain number of rows and columns optimally from a given image in a content aware manner.

IMAGES : TajMahal.jpg

FILES:
assignment7_Q1.m = This is the main function that implements the seam Carving algorithm and displays the final result.

FUNCTION FILES: 
energyIm.m = Computes the energy map of the input image.
seamCarving.m = Implement the seam Carving Algorithm.
seamImage.m = Implement the Dynamic programing part in order to find the seam path of minimum energy.
backTrack.m = Back Track the seam path to obtain the seam locations
removeSeam.m = remove the selected seam from the image.

PROBLEM-2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use appropriate energy measure and delete the object which is not of interest from the given image.

IMAGES: TajMahal.jpg

FILES:
assignment7_Q2.m = This is the main file which contains the program that takes the image as input and deletes the 
		   selected region from the image using the seam carving algorithm. The default region selected is 166 X 50 from the
		   top left corner of the original image.

objectRemove.m = Takes the image and the region to be removed as the input and gives the final image as the output.
