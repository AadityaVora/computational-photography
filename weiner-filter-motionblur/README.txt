NAME : 		ADITYA VORA
ROLL NUMBER :	14410006
DEPARTMENT :	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING

PROBLEM-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have one image on which we need to apply first of all motion blur effect. After applying motion blur to the image 
we are supposed to add gaussian noise to that motion blurred image and after that try to recover the original image
by applying weiner filtering by giving the standard deviation of noise as the input. We are supposed to repeat the procedure by varying the noise variance in the image. 

IMAGES : 1) image.png
	 

RESULTS:
Estimated noise to signal power ratio for different amounts of noise.
Noise with variance 0.001 Estimated NSPR: 0.0162
Noise with variance 0.002 Estimated NSPR: 0.0325
Noise with variance 0.003 Estimated NSPR: 0.0487
Noise with variance 0.004 Estimated NSPR: 0.0650
Noise with variance 0.005 Estimated NSPR: 0.0812 
Noise with variance 0.006 Estimated NSPR: 0.0974
Noise with variance 0.007 Estimated NSPR: 0.1137
Noise with variance 0.008 Estimated NSPR: 0.1299


PROBLEM-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have one image on which we need to apply first of all defocus blur effect. After applying defocus blur to the image 
we are supposed to add gaussian noise to that defocus blurred image and after that try to recover the original image
by applying weiner filtering by giving the standard deviation of noise as the input. We are supposed to repeat the procedure by varying the noise variance in the image.

** NOTE: In order to see the recovered images for different amounts of noise run the MATLAB script.
